<h2><a href="Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Melting Simulation with the Material Point Method</a></h2>
<div style="width:50%">
<h2>Abstract</h2>

The Material Point Method is a technique presented by Stomakhin et. al (2013) for use in
simulating deformable bodies. It was originially used to model snow for Walt Disney Animation
Studioâ€™s Frozen and has since been shown to produce good results for a large range of materials
behaviours including melting and solidification. The aim of this project was to implement the
melting simulation as outlined by Stomakhin et. al (2014) using C++ with import and export
from Houdini. The time span of the project allowed for an initial implementation of each part
of the technique, including interpolation between particles and grid, deviatoric and projected
velocity calculations and temperature updates resulting in a phase change. The results give the
effect of a deformable solid and a viscous fluid, however, future work is required to improve the
stability and accuracy of the solver.
